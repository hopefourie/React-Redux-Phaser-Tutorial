# Newt's Quest

Newt's Quest is a web-based platform game in which you venture through a magical forrest as Newt the gnome. The goblins of the dark wood have stolen your trusty wand and beloved gnome hat. You must get them back! First, find your wand, then cast a spell on any goblin that tries to get between you and your hat.

## Getting Started

1.  Fork and clone this repo.
2.  `npm install`.
3.  Create `newts-quest` database.
4.  Start the build process and your application with: `npm run start-dev`. If you're using Windows, you may need to execute `npm start` and `npm run build-watch` separately (in their own terminal tabs).
5.  Navigate to [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to see the site in the browser.
6.  Check out the starting seed file in `seed.js` - you can run it by executing `npm run seed`. You will need to seed the database once you've set up the Sequelize models.
